# Heyo!
This is my website. This is a gateway to my other projects that I have been working on.
I wrote this in **Markdown**, so I don't have to code a whole html file.
## My Projects

[Colbalt Media Downloader](https://cobalt.tools/)

A simple, but very powerful downloader for music, youtube videos, and more! See the supported services on the website.

[Spotfy.one](https://spotfy.one)

A free tool to listen to music with. It mirrors a YouTube link, so you have to manually play each song in a album.

[Squid.WTF](https://squid.wtf)

A Deezer FLAC ripper. Only used once for a project, but sounds good!

That's it... for now.
